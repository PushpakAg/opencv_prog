# opencv_prog
Hey! So while learning open-cv I wrote all this so I just added all the files I had.

## Note
face recognition prograns doesn't work on newer verison of python (python 3.11).
facial_recognition module will be easily downloaded on python 3.6.8 but it will give lots of issues if you use newer version. I tried on 3.10 also but failed.
There are solution available but its not very reliable.
